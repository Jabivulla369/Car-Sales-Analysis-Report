Project Title -  CARS SALES ANALYSIS DASHBOARD

üåê Overview of this project:-

There is a USA-based car dealership company that sells various car models, and now they want to track and analyze their sales performance.
To help them to do this I have Built a comprehensive 2-page Cars Sales Dashboard/ Report in Power BI to visualize critical KPIs and many other factors related to their car sales. This dashboard enables the company to understand its sales performance over time and make data-driven decisions.

üìä Objective:-

The objective of this project is to design and develop a dynamic and interactive Car Sales Dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard will visualize critical KPIs related to car sales, helping them to understand their sales performance over time and make data-driven decisions.

‚û°Ô∏è The flow of this project:-

‚úÖRequirement gathering - First of all gathered all the required queries from the client, like what they want to know or see in this report and the dataset.

‚úÖCleaning part - Load the Excel file in the power BI and checked all the column profile and their distribution (like if any null values are there or not, column formatting, etc) in the power query.

‚úÖData modeling - In this report, I used many time intelligence Dax functions and for that, I created a separate date table and then built the relationship between my main table and the date table.

‚úÖData Visualization - After completing all the formatting and modeling part, I built a mockup in Canva and then dived into the journey of creating insights.

‚öíÔ∏è Tools used -

Power BI: Used to develop the dashboard interface and integrate data sources.
Excel: Used for data preprocessing and cleaning before importing into Power BI.
Canva - For layout designing purpose

üîç Overall Insights/Analysis:-

‚úÖTotal YTD Sales - With it, there is Sales difference, YOY Growth percentage, and Total MTD sales, and the sales difference between the previous year and the current year (2023) is in green, which means the sales are increased as compared to the previous year.

‚úÖAvg YTD Price - With it, there is Avg price difference, YOY Growth percentage, and Avg MTD Price and the difference is in red means the avg price is reduced as compared to last year.

‚úÖTotal YTD cars Sold - With it there is cars sold difference, YOY Growth percentage and Total MTD Cars sold. In this case also we can see the Sales difference is in green means the company sold more cars than the previous year.

‚úÖAccording to the body style SUV cars are sold most as compared to the Hatchback and Sedans.

‚úÖAccording to the car's color, Pale white colored cars are sold most as compared to black and red colored cars

‚úÖAccording to the region, most cars are sold in the Austin Region

‚úÖCompany-wise sales are most for the Chevrolet as compared to the Dodge and Ford

Project Learnings:-

This project serves as an excellent learning experience for grasping the intricacies of Time Intelligence functions in Power BI. (Highly recommended)

1. In this iteration, my focus shifted towards delving into DAX functions rather than emphasizing dashboard design.

2. I did a little extra work instead of copying the whole dashboard, and I kept the approach minimalistic.

3. The objective was to comprehend the core meaning and logic behind these functions.

Now equipped with a deeper understanding, this dashboard showcases real-time insights into crucial KPIs like

‚Ä¢ YTD and MTD Total Sales

‚Ä¢ YOY Growth, Average Price Analysis

‚Ä¢ Cars Sold Metrics

‚Ä¢ YTD Sales Weekly Trend

‚Ä¢ YTD Total Sales by Body Style

‚Ä¢ YTD Total Sales by Color and a Company-Wise Sales Trend in Grid Form

The fun part is navigating through the updates in Power BI brought in a touch of excitement. I almost forgot how to use certain features as the platform evolves! It's like a treasure hunt, searching for the options in the middle of updates.
